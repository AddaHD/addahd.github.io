        We are a part of the Incredible Edible Network whose vision is to create kind, confident and connected communities through the power of food growing. It seeks to show how ordinary people can transform their own landscapes and turn green spaces into sources of food.
      </p>
      <p>Our goal is to share produce with our immediate community and charitable causes. To recycle, repurpose and be as sustainable as possible. To encourage a sharing, caring and kind ethos. Continue to provide a safe and welcoming environment for community volunteers to:
      </p>
      <p>
        Engage with nature;
        Promote physical and mental wellbeing;
        Meet new people;
        Learn new skills;
        Gain pride and confidence in growing a plant from seed to fruition;
        Provide social inclusion and help rehabilitate those isolated back into a safe social environment;
